Support library for using AWS with the VAST Platform (formerly VA Smalltalk) written in Smalltalk. This is the VAST Platform adaption of the project of [Jan van de Sandt](https://github.com/jvdsandt) at https://github.com/jvdsandt/pharo-aws-toolbox. The initial (partial) port to the VAST Platform was done by [Vince Mecking](https://github.com/McKing2nd) and [Adriaan van Os](https://github.com/adriaon).

## Installation

1. Install [VAST Platform 11](https://www.instantiations.com/vast-platform/).
2. Install Tonel support in your development image following [this guide](https://github.com/instantiations/tonel-vast#installation).
3. Clone this repository.
4. The easiest and recommended approach is to install it via a script:

```smalltalk
| loader path |
path := (CfsPath named: '<insert path to root `aws-toolbox-vast` local repo here>').
loader := TonelLoader readFromPath: path.
loader
	beUnattended; "do not prompt and use all defaults"
	useGitVersion.
loader loadAllMapsWithRequiredMaps.
```

Or you can load the Configuration Map `AWS` (and optionally `AWS Tests` if you want to run the unit tests) from the context menu of the Configuration Maps Browser: `"Import"` -> `"Load Configuration Maps from Tonel repository..."` -> select path to root `aws-toolbox-vast` local repo. This will open a dialog and will use convenient defaults for the load. Refer to [its documentation](https://github.com/instantiations/tonel-vast#using-gui-menus) for more details.

5. Optionally run the SUnit tests included in the map `AWS Tests` to ensure correct installation. One easy way is to right-click on the `AWS Tests` map name in the Name pane (as opposed to version pane) and then select `Test Loaded Applications`.
